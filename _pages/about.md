I am a Math and EECS and MEng student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Paul Liang (MIT)](https://pliang279.github.io/), [Jessy Li (UT Austin)](https://jessyli.com/), and [Byron Wallace (Northeastern)](https://www.byronwallace.com/).

I am broadly interested in artificial intelligence for science, multisensory intelligence, human-AI systems, factuality in AI, and information retrieval. I have recently been working on:
* Multi-document retrieval, synthesis, and reasoning of medical evidence for checking the factuality of medical claims made on social media
* Grounding LLMs in the physical world with sensor data

**I am applying to PhD programs this cycle.**

In my free time, I enjoy coffee and tea ☕🍵, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs 📸🐶.
