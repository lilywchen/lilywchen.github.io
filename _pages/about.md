I recently graduated from MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Paul Liang (MIT)](https://pliang279.github.io/), [Jessy Li (UT Austin)](https://jessyli.com/), and [Byron Wallace (Northeastern)](https://www.byronwallace.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy coffee and tea ☕🍵, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs 📸🐶.
