I am a Math and EECS and MEng student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Paul Liang (MIT)](https://pliang279.github.io/), [Jessy Li (UT Austin)](https://jessyli.com/), and [Byron Wallace (Northeastern)](https://www.byronwallace.com/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning, multimodal learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, and applications to healthcare. Research problems I have recently been working on:
* Multimodal synthesis and content creation
* Understanding non-verbal communication and emotions from gestures
* Grounding LLMs in the physical world with sensors
* Multi-document retrieval, synthesis, and reasoning of medical evidence for medical claim checking

In my free time, I enjoy tea üçµ, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs üì∏üê∂.
