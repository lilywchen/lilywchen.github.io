I am a Math and EECS and MEng student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Paul Liang (MIT)](https://pliang279.github.io/), [Jessy Li (UT Austin)](https://jessyli.com/), and [Byron Wallace (Northeastern)](https://www.byronwallace.com/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning, multimodal learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. I have recently worked on research problems in multimodal synthesis and content creation, grounding LLMs in the physical world with sensors, factuality, retrieval augmented generation, information synthesis, and applications in health.

In my free time, I enjoy tea üçµ, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs üì∏üê∂.
