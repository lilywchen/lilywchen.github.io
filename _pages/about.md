I am a Math and EECS student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Jessy Li](https://jessyli.com/) and [Byron Wallace](https://www.byronwallace.com/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I have recently worked on research problems in factuality, retrieval augmented generation, information synthesis, and applications to the medical domain.

In my free time, I enjoy tea üçµ, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs üì∏üê∂.
