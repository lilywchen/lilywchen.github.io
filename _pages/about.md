I am a Math and EECS and MEng student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by [Jessy Li (UT Austin)](https://jessyli.com/), [Byron Wallace (Northeastern)](https://www.byronwallace.com/), and [Paul Liang (MIT)](https://pliang279.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning, multimodal learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, and applications to healthcare. I have recently been working on:
* Multi-document retrieval, synthesis, and reasoning of medical evidence for checking the factuality of medical claims made on social media
* Grounding LLMs in the physical world with sensor data

In my free time, I enjoy coffee and tea ‚òïüçµ, long walks, following the NBA, and photographing French Bulldogs üì∏üê∂.
